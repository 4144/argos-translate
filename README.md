## Installation
Argos Translate is being developed/tested to run on Linux in a Snap container. However since it is written in Python it should run with minimal modifications on other platforms.

### Snap installation
1. Install [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd) if it isn't already installed.
2. Using snapd install snapcraft:
```
sudo snap install snapcraft
```
3. Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate.git
cd argos-translate
```
4. From the root directory of this project build the snap package:
```
snapcraft
```
5. Install the snap package:
```
sudo snap install --devmode argos-translate_<version information>.snap
```
6. Run Argos Translate!
```
argos-translate
```
### Python installation
1. Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate.git
cd argos-translate
```
2. Make a virtual environment to install it in (optional):
```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
3. Install this package with pip:
```
pip install .
```
4. This will just install the python code for the gui and running models. To get the models download [models.zip here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11wxM3Ze7NCgOk_tdtRjwet10DmtvFu3i), unzip it, and run `argos-translate` from the same directory as the models/ directory. 

## Models
The models are a work in progress and are being trained using [this](https://github.com/argosopentech/onmt-models) training script. You can customize what directory your models are stored in in the top of argos_translate/translate.py or use the training script to train your own models.
